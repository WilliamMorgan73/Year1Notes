## Arrays
A data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index.
The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, and the index allows for easy and efficient access to any element in the array.

### How do we find the nth element of the list
Access the nth index

### How do we erase an element
Data can not be erased from an array as they are immutable
We can do alternatives such as shifting all elements, or swapping with the last element.

## Linked lists
A list made up of nodes.
Each node stores:
1. An element
2. A pointer to another node
First node is called the **head**
Last node is called the **tail** and points to null
Can be scattered all other memory

# Chapter 1 summarised
Chapter 1 of _Mastering Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn_ is titled "The Fundamentals of Machine Learning." It introduces core concepts in machine learning, including the following key points:

- **Definition of Machine Learning**: Machine learning is defined as the study of programs that improve their performance on a task by learning from data or experience. The goal is to generalize from examples to induce rules or patterns.
    
- **Types of Learning**: The chapter distinguishes between supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, programs learn from labelled data (e.g., email spam filtering). In unsupervised learning, the program discovers patterns in unlabelled data (e.g., clustering people based on height and weight).
    
- **Common Tasks**: Machine learning tasks include classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Classification assigns labels to data, regression predicts continuous values, clustering groups data points, and dimensionality reduction simplifies data.
    
- **Data**: The chapter covers the importance of using **training data**, **testing data**, and **validation data** to build and evaluate models. Training data helps the model learn, testing data evaluates performance, and validation data fine-tunes models.
    
- **Bias and Variance**: The trade-off between bias (error due to assumptions in the model) and variance (error due to sensitivity to small data fluctuations) is introduced.
    

Finally, the chapter introduces the Scikit-learn library, a Python library for machine learning, and provides instructions for its installation.
